# Mixed Message Generator

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer career path. It's a simple mixed message generator implemented in JavaScript.

## Purpose

The Mixed Message Generator creates random, humorous messages by combining different elements:
- Artists
- Streamers
- Close friends

Each time you run the program, it generates a unique message that creates an unexpected scenario involving these characters.

Here are some examples of messages that can be generated:

1. "Post Malone just collabed with Ninja on a charity livestream, and A couldn't stop laughing at their antics!"
2. "In a parallel universe, PewDiePie is actually Billie Eilish's biggest fan, and R is their manager."
3. "Breaking news: Eminem just challenged Kai Cenat to a dance-off, and D is the surprise judge!"
4. "N dreamt they switched lives with Childish Gambino for a day, but ended up in Speed's streaming room instead."
5. "If Metro Booming, Ohne Pixel, and I started a band, they'd call themselves 'The Improbable Trio'."
